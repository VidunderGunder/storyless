# ðŸ¥· Figma to SVG

Figma to SVG is a CLI tool that allows you to download SVGs from a specific frame in Figma

_it probably works for entire files too, but that's not our use case â€“ so feel free to try it out and let us know!_

## ðŸ“‹ You'll need

1. A Figma API token (see the guide [here](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens))
2. A Figma file URL (you can get one by opening a file in Figma, selecting a frame and copying the URL)
3. Optionally, a path to save the SVGs to (defaults to `./svgs/`)

## ðŸš€ Usage

Prepare your icons and copy the frame's URL:

![Figma frame URL](./frame.png)

Then, run the CLI:

```bash
npx @storyless/figma-to-svg # npm
yarn dlx @storyless/figma-to-svg # yarn
pnpx @storyless/figma-to-svg # pnpm
bunx @storyless/figma-to-svg # bun
```

You can also pass parameters to the CLI, to skip the prompts:

```bash
bunx @storyless/figma-to-svg --url "https://www.figma.com/file/yourfileidhere/Project-Name?node-id=69%3A420&mode=dev" --token "figd_23eredgfEegdf-0910g2ojsDjjek-kPbbzmmo6twXG4" --out "./some/folder/"
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The example uses `bunx`, but you can also use `npx`, `yarn dlx`, `pnpx` or any other package runner.

> [!TIP]  
> If the command fails, try specifying the exact version of the package, e.g. `bunx @storyless/figma-to-svg@x.x.x`
>
> Find the latest version [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storyless/figma-to-svg?activeTab=versions)
